* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/zammad/zammad/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new (link: https://github.com/zammad/zammad text: GitHub) pull request with the patch.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Suggest your change in the [zammad-core mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/zammad-core) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

## Do you want to contribute translations?

* Just open your Zammad with admin permissions and press "ctrl+alt+t", then you can translate text in inline mode or go to "Admin Interface" -> "Translations". Here you can translate all in one table.

That's all. Isn't it easy! 🤓
