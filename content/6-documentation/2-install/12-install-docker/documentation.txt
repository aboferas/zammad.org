Title: Install with Docker
----

Text:

Docker is a container-based software framework for automating deployment of applications. Our Docker image is a **single container** based application designed to have Zammad **up and running fast for testing proposes**.

Your Docker environment needs to be up and running.

You can find the image at https://hub.docker.com/r/zammad/zammad/

### Download the Docker Image

Let’s begin using Docker! Download the Zammad Docker image:

```bash
docker pull zammad/zammad
```

### Run a Docker Container
Docker run will run a command in a new container, -i attaches stdin and stdout, -t allocates a tty, and we’re using the standard Zammad container.

```bash
docker run -ti -p 3001:80 zammad/zammad
```

That’s it! You’re now using a bash shell inside of a Zammad docker container.

To disconnect or detach from the shell without exiting, use the escape sequence Ctrl-p + Ctrl-q.


### Go to http://localhost:3001 and you'll see:
  "Welcome to Zammad!", there you need to create your admin user and you need to invite other agents.
