Title: Install with RPM
----

Text:

Currently we support RHEL7/CentOS7.


### Add Zammad & epel-release RPM repos and install RPM

```bash
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo rpm --import https://rpm.packager.io/key
```

CentOS7

```bash
echo "[zammad]
name=Repository for zammad/zammad application.
baseurl=https://rpm.packager.io/gh/zammad/zammad/centos7/stable
enabled=1" | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/zammad.repo
```

```bash
sudo yum install zammad
```

Add your FQDN to servername or ip directive in /etc/nginx/conf.d/zammad.conf and
restart nginx if you're not testing localy.


You can manage the Zammad services manually:
```bash
shell> sudo service zammad status
shell> sudo service zammad stop
shell> sudo service zammad start
shell> sudo service zammad restart

# only web application server
shell> sudo service zammad-web status
shell> sudo service zammad-web stop
shell> sudo service zammad-web start
shell> sudo service zammad-web restart

# only worker process
shell> sudo service zammad-worker status
shell> sudo service zammad-worker stop
shell> sudo service zammad-worker start
shell> sudo service zammad-worker restart

# only websocket server
shell> sudo service zammad-websocket status
shell> sudo service zammad-websocket stop
shell> sudo service zammad-websocket start
shell> sudo service zammad-websocket restart
```

### Go to http://localhost:3000 and you'll see:
  "Welcome to Zammad!", there you need to create your admin user and you need to invite other agents.
