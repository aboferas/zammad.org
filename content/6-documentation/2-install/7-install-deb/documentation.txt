Currently we support Debian 8 & Ubuntu 16.04


# Add Zammad DEB Repo and install

```bash
wget -qO - https://deb.packager.io/key | sudo apt-key add -
```

## Debian

```bash
echo "deb https://deb.packager.io/gh/zammad/zammad jessie stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zammad.list
```

## Ubuntu

```bash
echo "deb https://deb.packager.io/gh/zammad/zammad xenial stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zammad.list
```

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install zammad
```

# Start Zammad services:

```bash
sudo systemctl zammad start
```

You can manage the Zammad services manually:
```bash
shell> sudo systemctl zammad status
shell> sudo systemctl zammad stop
shell> sudo systemctl zammad start
shell> sudo systemctl zammad restart

# only web application server
shell> sudo systemctl zammad-web status
shell> sudo systemctl zammad-web stop
shell> sudo systemctl zammad-web start
shell> sudo systemctl zammad-web restart

# only worker process
shell> sudo systemctl zammad-worker status
shell> sudo systemctl zammad-worker stop
shell> sudo systemctl zammad-worker start
shell> sudo systemctl zammad-worker restart

# only websocket server
shell> sudo systemctl zammad-websocket status
shell> sudo systemctl zammad-websocket stop
shell> sudo systemctl zammad-websocket start
shell> sudo systemctl zammad-websocket restart
```

# Go to http://localhost and you'll see:
  "Welcome to Zammad!", there you need to create your admin user and you need to invite other agents.
