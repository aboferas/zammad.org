Title: All about the Ticket
----

Text:

A ticket is a container for a conversation with the customer about one dedicated topic/issue.


### Ticket States

In default setup Zammad has the following ticket states:

  * new
    * Ticket is created by customer, no agent has sent out a response to the customer right now
    * If an agent replies to the customer, the ticket will change its state to "open" automatically

  * open
    * Ticket is open, an agent needs to work on it (e. g. close it or set a pending reminder state to let others know that somebody is working later on it)

  * pending reminder
    * Tickets which will "sleep" (no further action/attention needed right now) till pending date is reached
    * Tickets will not escalate (in case of escalation, escalation is suspended)
    * The time where the ticket is in pending reminder is not counted for escalation

  * pending close
    * Tickets which will "sleep" (no further action/attention needed right now) till pending date is reached
    * Tickets will not escalate (in case of escalation, escalation is suspended)
    * The time where the ticket is in pending close is not counted for escalation
    * After pending time is reached, the ticket will be closed by Zammad automatically

  * closed
    * Ticket is solved/finished, no further action/attention needed


### Ticket Colors

On almost every place in the UI where a ticket is shown you will see a colored circle. The color shows you if the ticket needs attention:

  * Orange
    * Ticket is created, somebody needs to work on it
    * Pending reminder of ticket has been reached, somebody needs to work on it

  * Red
    * Ticket is escalated, somebody needs to work immediately on this ticket to cancel escalaction state (e. g. needs to send out a customer response or set the ticket to pending reminder until somebody can solve the ticket)

  * Green
    * Ticket is closed, no further action/attention needed

  * Dark gray
    * Pending reminder or pending close is set but not yet reached, no further action/attention needed right now
