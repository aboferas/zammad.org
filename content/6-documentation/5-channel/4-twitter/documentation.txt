It's possible to put your Twitter communication into Zammad. To do so, you need to follow these steps:

### Register Twitter app

Register your Zammad as Twitter app under http://apps.twitter.com. It's required to let Zammad read/write tweets.

Next we need to set _read, write and access direct messages permissions_ for the app.
