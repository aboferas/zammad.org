It's possible to put your Facebook Page communication into Zammad. To do so, you need to follow these steps:

### Register Facebook app

Register your Zammad as Facebook app under https://developers.facebook.com.

You need to do the following:

* Go to Settings -> Basic
* "+ add Platform" -> Website and enter your Zammad URL link http://support.zammad.com
* Fill "App Domains", "Contact Email", "Privacy Policy URL", "Terms of Service URL" and add a app icon

Finally "Save Changes".

In order to read and write on facebook pages we need to get "publish_pages" and "manage_pages" permissions.

Go to "App Review" and request them.

Finally go to Settings -> Basic -> "App Secret" -> "Show" and note the "App ID" and "App Secret".
